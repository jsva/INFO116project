We have constructed an ontology with some basic competency questions in mind.
We want our ontology to be able to answer both basic questions about wine/what products
vinmonopolet has as well as some more advanced ones.

We therefore included information such as who produced the beverage, where they are located,
what type of food the beverage suits. Basic information about the beverage provided by vinmonopolet
as well as what the wine is made off and how the taste is classified.

Our main question about is about how we decided to do our instance of beverages by having them be 
an instane of several classes. We are not sure if this is allowed or proper to do, and even if it is
if we might have done it too much and that some of these relationships should rather be 
expressed through object properties(but then again you can't express relations between a class
and instance with a object property which is why we did it this way). We are also unsure if some
classes especially "Råstoff" and "smak_og_aroma" might be better suited as data properties.

Concerning Data properties we wonder if we have chosen the correct data types, or if it's possible
to do this in a better way, e.g. being able to restrict data properties such as "garvestoff"
between levels of 1-12 instead of it just being an integer.
